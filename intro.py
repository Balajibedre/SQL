SQL is a Standard - BUT....


Although SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard, there are different versions of the SQL language.

However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands 
(such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE) in a similar manner.

The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.

The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set.
